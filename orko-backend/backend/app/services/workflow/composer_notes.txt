This file will guide the design of ORKO’s Workflow Composer.
Later: connect Composer UI to workflow actions.

# Composer Layout Ideas

* User drags actions into canvas
* ORKO connects actions based on inputs and outputs

Later: automatic line-drawing between actions.
Later: clickable action editor panel.

# Dynamic Loader Integration Ideas
- Composer should list actions after dynamic loader runs.
- User can click action names to see details.

# Template Integration Ideas
- Composer UI may show default action templates.
- User can duplicate templates to build custom actions.

# Category Integration Ideas
- Composer UI may show categories to help organize actions.
- User can expand or collapse categories to navigate actions.

# Error Handling Ideas
- Composer UI will highlight invalid actions or broken links.
- Users will receive clear error messages for debugging.

# Versioning Ideas
- Composer UI may show version numbers next to each action.
- Users can upgrade or downgrade action versions visually.

# Evaluation & Metrics Ideas
- Composer and Dashboard may show basic metrics for each action set (success rate, error rate).
- Admins may see evaluation summaries for parser accuracy and workflow success over time.

# Permission & Access Control Ideas
- Composer UI may hide restricted actions for regular users.
- Admin users may unlock advanced action-building or lifecycle controls.

# Logging Ideas
- Composer UI may show execution logs or action-level messages.
- Admin view may include detailed logs for debugging and performance.
