Telegram → sends chat messages to your system (via a webhook URL).

WhatsApp → sends chat messages via Twilio to your system (webhook).

Gmail / Microsoft 365 (Outlook) → provide emails your system pulls regularly 
(API fetch via Gmail API or MS Graph API).

Drive / SharePoint → provide files your system watches (API change feed).

ORKO Backend → has three parts: Front Door (FastAPI Router), Queue, Processor.

WHY IT MATTERS
• One front door (FastAPI Router) keeps everything organized and secure.  
• The Queue prevents overload and ensures no message is lost.  
• The Processor normalizes and stores data so later brains (knowledge, pattern, skill) work smoothly.

ONE-SENTENCE PATH
Telegram / WhatsApp / Gmail / Microsoft 365 / Files → FastAPI Router (/ingest/message) → Queue → Processor → Database (+ Vector Index later)

GLOSSARY
Router → Your front door (web URL) that receives incoming data.  
Queue → A safe waiting line that stores messages before processing.  
Processor → The worker that takes each message from the line and saves it to the database.  
Schema → The agreed list of fields each message must have (source, sender, timestamp, content, attachments).  
Webhook → A URL that external apps call to deliver data automatically.
